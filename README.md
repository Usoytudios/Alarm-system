i'll made allarm system for school warning system in Ukraine
It's basically a simple program with a basic interface—like, you just pick your sounds. It pulls alarm announcements straight from the JSON file of Ukraine's general notification system. The cool part? It was made specifically for this school and connects directly to the city’s notification system, making the alerts insanely fast.
